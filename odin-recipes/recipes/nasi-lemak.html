      <li>1 (1/2 inch) piece fresh ginger, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
      <li>1 whole bay leaf</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Garnish:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup oil for frying</li>
      <li>1 cup raw peanuts</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) package anchovies, washed</li>
      <li>4 large hard-boiled eggs, peeled and halved</li>
      <li>1 medium cucumber, sliced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>1 medium onion, sliced</li>
      <li>3 medium shallots, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>3 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons chili paste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon water, or more as needed (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 (4 ounce) package anchovies, washed</li>
      <li>1/4 cup tamarind juice</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
      <li>Making the rice. Stir coconut milk, water, rice, fresh ginger, ground ginger, bay lead, and salt together in a medium saucepan.</li>
      <li>Cover and bring to a boil over medium heat. Reduce the heat and simmer until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Discard bay leaf and keep rice warm until garnish and sauce are ready.</li>
      <li>While the rice is cooking, make the garnish: Heat 1 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in peanuts and cook briefly, until lightly browned. Remove peanuts with a slotted spoon and place onto paper towels to soak up excess grease.</li>
      <li>Return the skillet to the stove. Stir in anchovies and cook, turning occasionally, until crisp, 2 to 3 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon and place on paper towels. Discard oil and wipe out the skillet.</li>
      <li>Making the sauce. Heat oil in the clean skillet. Stir in onion, shallots, and garlic; cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
      <li>Mix in chili paste and cook for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally; if mixture is too dry, add water as needed.</li>
      <li>Stir in anchovies and cook for 5 minutes. Stir in tamarind juice, sugar, and salt; simmer until sauce thickens, 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
      <li>Ladle warm rice into bowls. Top with the sauce, peanuts, fried anchovies, hard-boiled eggs, and cucumber slices.</li>
    </ol>
